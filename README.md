# CSCI 7950 - Selected Topics in Compiler Writing

# Learning Outcomes
<!--
Please, list your research questions & goals (aka learning outcomes): what questions do you want to answer, what skills do you want to develop, what you hope to gain if you complete this class successfully.

Remember:

    1. Learning outcomes should be specific and well defined.
    2. Learning outcomes should be realistic and achievable.
    3. Learning outcomes should be measureable.
    4. Learning outcomes should be written in simple language with active verbs.
    
    (<https://www.colorado.edu/oda/sites/default/files/attached-files/program_learning_outcomes_v2.pdf>)

    Another potentially good source to help you draft your learning outcomes is <https://assessment.wisc.edu/student-learning-outcomes/writing-student-learning-outcomes/>.
    
Examples includes:

    - Developing a pass that can be integrated in the latest available version of LLVM and displays "Hello world" in the terminal when a program is compiled.
    - Write a parser for a simple language capable of handling variable declaration and conditional statements.
    - Understand the difference between SLR parsers, LALR parsers, LR(1) parsers, and generalized LR parsers.
-->

1. Identify the components of an LLVM pass and the requirements for writing a pass for LLVM.
2. Write a simple _Hello World_ pass for LLVM.
3. Write a detection pass for LLVM.
4. Write a simple transformation pass for LLVM.
5. Write a loop transformation pass for LLVM.

(Refining of these Q's is likely needed)

<!-- Once you are done with your timeline, please go back to your learning outcomes (research questions / goals), and wonder: are you giving you enough time to complete them all? Did new learning outcomes emerge from your timeline? If your mapping from weeks to learning outcomes, or from learning outcomes to weeks is partial, then something is wrong.-->

# Tools
- This repository!
- Linux/WSL
- LLVM
- Potentially more? (Will likely find out what I need as I go)
<!-- List the tools & services you will be using. Please, prefer cross-OS, open-source & free tools as much as possible, and prefer if possible services that are free of charge. -->

List the resources you plan on using, ideally with precise bibliographical references and / or links.
Be specific: don't go on listing all the textbooks ever written on compilers, but refer precisely to e.g., Chapters or Sections of various material. Ideally, you could even tie those references back to your learning outcomes and (transitively) to your timeline.
